# Chungoid.zip: The Ultimate Decompression Bomb

Welcome to Chungoid.zip – the decompression bomb designed to melt everything it comes in contact with!

## About
Chungoid.zip is not your average zip file. It's a carefully crafted decompression bomb, also known as a "zip of death" or "zip bomb," engineered by me to push the limits of digital storage and cybersecurity. With 18 layers of nested zip files, each containing 16 more zips within, Chungoid.zip is a force to be reckoned with. Caution is advised! The file is 11.zip (passwd=11).

## Introducing the Chungobyte: An Absolute Unit
But Chungoid.zip isn't just about destruction – it's also about redefining the scale of digital storage. Inspired by the sheer magnitude of Chungoid.zip, I introduce the Chungobyte (ChB) – an absolute unit of digital storage capacity that surpasses anything currently recognized by the International System of Units. Chungobyte symbolizes the boundary-pushing nature of technological innovation and serves as a reminder of the vast potential and power of digital data.
